# gfbrowser

Basic web screen, can run with other backends but the goal is to be run using a EGL backend.  Build using buildroot and the gfbrowser package.  When compiling with QT5 enable qtwebkit, eglfs, opengl support in buildroot-052015.  EGL backend needs to be  available either by mesa3D, rpi-userland, etc.
